# Stellar-Classification

This repository contains an in-depth analysis and classification of stellar objects using various machine learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to accurately classify stars based on their features.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand the distribution of different stellar features. The EDA process helps us understand the data and identify any patterns or relationships that may exist.

## Classification Algorithms Used

We have employed a range of popular machine learning algorithms to classify stellar objects. The algorithms used in this project include:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

For each algorithm, we have applied appropriate preprocessing techniques, trained the model on the labeled stellar dataset, and evaluated its performance using various evaluation metrics.

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of each classification model, we have utilized a set of evaluation metrics, including:

- Accuracy: measures the overall correctness of the classification results.
- Precision: measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all predicted positives.
- Recall: measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positives.
- F1-score: provides a balanced measure of precision and recall.
- Confusion Matrix: presents a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions for each class.

The evaluation results for each algorithm are included in the repository, providing insights into their individual strengths and weaknesses in stellar classification.
